Well, basically, it follows directly from the idea of continuity. What if our target function predicting $y$ was continuous? If that were true, then for a point at a certain location, we could assume that points close to that location would be kind of close to the value at that location. It's becomes a cumulative probability distribution, where every point in the training set is understood to have an area of influence that tapers off based on how far away an input is from that point. It also has a weight, or the value that area of influence imposes on the input.\n","\n","So the influence on any input $ x $ is dependent on the exponential distribution to a given point $ \\mu $ by the following equation:\n","\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\large\n","\\forall \\mu, f(\\mathbf{x}) \\propto e^{-\\lambda \\mathbf{ \\| x - \\mu \\| } ^ 2}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"CGRN6SR6dWM6","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","Now in this case $ \\lambda$ is the rate at which the influence of any given point tapers off as the input moves farther away for a $\\mu$.

Some datasets have records on the order of $10^5$. That's ridiculous, and it would make no sense to to run the whole calculation. So instead we generate a set of $K$ different $\\mu$s, or 'K-means'. These means are representative points for the entire dataset given to us. I haven't come across any specific rule of thumb while choosing $K$, so what I'm going to do is have $K \\propto \\log{N}$.

Well this whole experiment rested on one assumption: continuity. We just assumed that our function would be a continuous one. Was that a bad assumption? Sometimes it is. But if it was, there would be no point doing any of this, and at the very least the fact that both the in and out of sample models converge at the same time looks very promising. It shows we DID learn a continuous trend, just not the right one. Let's assume the opposite then. Continuity is good. We want continuity. But are we getting what we wanted?
